To compile with CMake, please do as follows:

Ensure that CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH contains
the installation path of xtensor or
xtensor-stack.

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make


To compile without CMake, we need to link with
openblas, pthread and gfortran.

For example,

G xt1.cc -lopenblas -pthread -lgfortran
